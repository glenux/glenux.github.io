Affirmations

* devops est une mode, qui va s'estomper. C'est un cri face aux nouvelles possibilités et aux nouveaux outils. Mais cela va devenir "normal".
  
  > When something is hot in tech, people make it out to be like a movement of ideals. After it fades from popularity, people forget about the religious stuff and focus on what it can do for their business.
  
  > **/u/fundieInAChainWay** : Everyone is devopsing, while I'm just here sysadmining.

* les recruteurs d'aujourd'hui ne comprennent pas :)

## What is devops ?

I actually really like Adam Jacob's definition:

> "DevOps is the word we use to describe the operational side of the transition to enterprises being software-led".
> It's about a way of doing work. It's not a job you have. People hate hearing this, but it's like calling yourself an "agile".

Devops is:

* A technical and cultural movement with automation at its core
* A faster and safer way to deliver value to customers
* A set of practices established by web innovators that are now being adopted by enterprises of all kinds.

**/u/soawesomejohn**:  

> [...] DevOps is a culture - a combination of Operations people and Developer people.  [...]

> The key here is the part where the Ops people and the Devs are working together to automate everything. It's not just about automation, but repeatability. Your QA and Staging environments will probably have to get rebuilt to specific versions all the time, so you have to go from bare metal/virtual to working environment quickly and with minimal human involvement.

> [...]  I'm definitely in the "sysadmin who does automation" camp.

## Retours d'expérience

> **/u/ohcrapitssteve** : DevOps has changed the way I do Sysadmin stuff; I realize a lot of DevOps folks came to the table from the Dev side. I came from the ops side and love it. 

> **/u/radeky** : To me, DevOps is about adopting those practices which allow you to serve your customers better. In your example, the UAT team is the customer and your work with AWS and Chef is what allows them (and you) to do their jobs more efficiently than if you were in the datacenter inserting boot cds into trays.
